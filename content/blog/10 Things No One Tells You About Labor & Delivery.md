10 things nobody tells you during labor and delivery.

I had my first child a little over a year ago, and I remember that day quite vividly. I thought to myself, “WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THIS?” or “I DID NOT KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN”. I even wrote everything that I did not expect during labor and delivery after I gave birth, because it was not how I imagined it to be. There were good and bad. But, DON’T BE SCARED! If I could go through birth again to have my son, I would.

(Please keep in mind all delivery is different and I am just sharing with you my experience.)

Here is my top 10 list no one tells you about Labor and Delivery.

**1.** **No one can prepare you for the pain of contractions**. First time mom and I did not know what contractions was. Everyone told me it was like a cramp. CAN I SAY IT WAS NOT JUST LIKE A CRAMP. It’s the boss level of cramps. The pain was so unbearable that I threw up and cried. The easiest way to describe a contraction for me was like a wave that I felt from beginning to end that hurts so bad with pain from lower back and then tightening all the way across your belly. Trust me when you know you’re having a contraction. It was probably the worst part of labor. I thought I was such a wimp, because I went in to get checked after I had bled a little. The doctor said I was only at 1cm, and probably wouldn’t give birth till next week or the week after. But, little did I know I went from 1CM to 5 CM in a few hours, and gave birth that same day I went in to the hospital.

(A little note I would like to add is that, YOU know your body. If it doesn’t seem or feel right, then trust your instinct. I was sent home after the first time, and I suffered the pain for a few hours because I didn’t think I could give birth that day per the doctor, and wow were they wrong.)

**2. You still feel pain**. I went in with the mindset of getting epidural and I won’t feel a thing afterwards. But, I found out even with epidural you still feel pain. It does not completely numb you. So, don’t expect to be numb because or as my nurse said you won’t feel the “pressure to push”. Or I would have to get a C-section. Also,I would like to add you can’t get epidural until they are satisfied with the amount of saline in an IV, left to go in the bag. I was like “WHAT?”, and it was the longest 20-30 of my life.

**3. You will have this distinct smell**. This smell made me want to vomit, and it smelled so musty like a cross between a hospital and old blood. It’s called Lochia. It’s a discharge we get after giving birth. I had it for 7 weeks…my husband was such a trooper. He pretended like he didn't smell it, which made me feel better.

4\. **No one knows your body like you do.** Which brings me to.... no one can tell you when you will be a certain cm or how long you’ll be dilated for. I went in at 1:30 am for bleeding, they sent me home because I was only 1cm and they don’t think I was going to be giving birth that day. They told me to wait until the contraction lasts for 2-3 minutes for an hour or so. (My contractions never lasted for 2-3 minutes, but my contractions were 1 min and I was already ready to give birth). So, I went back home and I started contracting for 1 mins every 4 mins, for a few hours. I couldn’t take the pain anymore , but I didn’t want to risk getting sent back. So, we drove to the hospital and waited in the parking lot until I couldn’t take it anymore. I went in, and they checked it I was at 5CM from 1:30-6:30 AM. So everyone is different, it’s better to get checked.

**5.** **Epidural for me was painless**. One thing during the labor process that I was scared of was epidural. I even watched Youtube videos to mentally prepare my mind. Everyone I've talked to said it hurt or will hurt. To my surprise, It did not hurt. I was even contracting at 5 cm, and my water was breaking at the time they inserted the needle, and I did not feel a thing, and that’s coming from someone who is deathly scared of needles and any kind of pain. Especially, when my epidural wore off when I gave birth...But, that’s another story.

**6. I did not expect to be sewn up raw,** and the shots they give you does not numb anything. I had a 2nd degree tear and I got stitches, my epidural wore off so fast that I felt every pinch of needle that I got. I couldn’t even concentrate on my baby because the nurse was sewing me for 20 minutes. 

**7.** **Peeing hurts..and sitting hurts so bad.** it really hurts. Like it burns. You will need that peri bottle they give you or use the Frida baby bottle I find works so much better! (check out my list of things I used to help under "SHOP") or check out the link below. I'm super sensitive down there and I did not like the dermaplast spray that they give you. But, I did used the Earth Mama everytime I used the restroom after squeezing myself with the Frida Baby bottle, and then put on my diapers. This is game changer.

**8.** **The first fart and poo hurts**, because of my hemorrhoids. I got a pretty bad hemorrhoid during childbirth and I could not sit or lay down or get comfortable. The nurse even freaked out when she saw it because she was so scared it would explode. So expect there to be A LOT of discomfort. I was so scared to take my first poo because I had so much stitches. Yes, it did hurt. I used a donut pillow which I didn't know existed until the 2nd week of suffering. THIS HELPED ME SO MUCH. I cannot stress this enough, this helped eased the pain of sitting down. 

**9.** **Don't overpack your hospital bag.** Everything in the hospital I packed I didn’t use... except a toothbrush and toothpaste and face wash and camera. I was told my every youtube videos or blog I watched to pack this and that for the hospital bag. And don’t over stress about packing, because when you start contracting and going through labor the last thing you’ll worry about is your cute matching robe with the baby (which I’m guilty of packing...)

**10.** **You will be bleeding a lot**. Like I mean a lot before, during, after birth. Be extra careful of the pads and the mesh underwear or any kind of pads it kind of hurt to peel it off my skin... I had so much blood that it got stuck to my skin and it tugged on my stitches a bit. I linked it below. THIS IS THE LIFESAVER! It's the adult diaper underwear. I swear by it. This is what I wore when i was bleeding so much for the first few weeks. They are comfortable and disposable. Also, I wanted to add after birth they push on your stomach to make sure you’re not hemorrhaging and getting rid of excess blood. They push so hard, it was so painful so be prepare for that pain after giving birth and your placenta.

Here you have it. 10 things no one tells you about labor and delivery. I’m definitely going to do a part 2, because there were just so many thing I thought I was prepared for. But, I wasn’t. Did you experience anything similar? Or was there anything that you were not prepared for?

Until next time!
