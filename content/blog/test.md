# HI THERE!

 Welcome to my first introduction post. My name is Pricilla and I am a mom to a 1 year old, Leo. I started this blog to share the story of my son's eczema and severe multiple food allergies, and educate and support others with what I have learned throughout this journey. I know the people that have experienced or know someone in similar situations would know that this journey is difficult, challenging, and sometimes can feel so lonely. But, you are not alone. I went through and still am, and we are in this together. 

## IT STARTED WITH A RASH

When Leo was about 3-4 months old, we noticed dry marks or what looks like a rash on his face. He also had this red spot on his scalp that the doctor said were cradle cap. We had visited several doctors and was reassured that this is very normal, and will go away. The doctors had said to use some cream, shampoo, and detergent. A month or so later, Leo’s skin condition had gotten so much worse it had spread from his face to his body, and pretty soon he lost all his hair. This broke my heart so badly during at this time, because I went to give him a bath one day, and noticed his hair fell out in clumps and his skin looked so infected even after following all instructions. In that timespan, we saw 5 different doctors and 2 different dermatologist, who all just brushed it off as if this was “normal” and just prescribed medication or told us to use different creams. They also brushed off when I had described what we went through with watching, and trying to prevent our baby scratching till he bled. Leo would  cry a lot because he was so itchy and in so much pain for months. I was determined to get to the bottom of this. If I knew what I knew now, I would saved myself so much heartache...

## THIS IS NOT NORMAL

While, everyone I know that gave birth the same time as me, their baby hit all their milestones, and taking pictures of their little ones out and about. Here, I was holding my baby 24/7 and couldn’t take him out, because if I didn’t he would scratch and cry. He would scratch until he bled. But, the doctor said this was normal (again) and as a result of his severe eczema and atopic dermatitis skin condition. This was not normal. I did not want to believe this was happening to my baby. I was so determined to get to the bottom of this. I spent countless hours researching on eczema, and it was so hard to find anything different than what the doctors had said. They had said there really is no cure, and Leo would grown out of it. But, instead of accepting it, and hoping it goes away. I dedicated all my free time to researching and educating myself. I told myself I would do whatever I can to help him feel better, and I focused on helping my son feel better and try to find what is triggering his flare ups.

## EMERGENCY ROOM

Fast forward to February 2020, his skin was so bad he developed a severe reaction where we ended up in the emergency room two times. To this day, the doctors still is unsure what triggered the severe reaction. But, his skin started swelling up, blistered, and leaked clear fluid all over (which I later found out was due to his eczema getting infected.) The doctors had given him a steroid to help, and it did help for a few days. But, the eczema came right back. This was the last straw. I knew that his skin was from the inside or it had to do with an allergy to something. 

## CONTINUING OUR JOURNEY

I had talked to my doctor to refer me to an allergist, and this is where it changed my and my baby’s life. That is a story for another day, but I completely had invested all my free time to researching his skin condition, changing routines, only wearing certain swapping different creams, soaps, and detergents. Etc,.. I did everything I could to try and help my baby heal. Through trials and errors, I was able to tremendously improve his condition. But, this was just a gist of the story. I started this blog to help and educate others that are going through the same situation as me. I have so many things to share with you all!
