HOW KABRITA HELPED HEAL MY BABY’S EZCEMA

This is from my experience and would like to share with you my story, and I would like to add that while Kabrita goat milk has made a significant difference, I still had to maintain a strict skincare/daily routine in order to keep his skin from flaring up. Everything I've tried has been okayed by Leo's doctor, but might not be the same for you. Please read the disclaimer below, and talk with your provider before trying anything.

**MILK-BASED FORMULA EXPERIENCE:**

I breastfed my son for most of his life but was in the process of weaning him off breastmilk to formula, and also used as a supplement when I was not producing enough milk. I decided to use Similac Sensitive which was okayed by his doctor, and also that is what I was given in the hospital when Leo had a hard time latching.

During the doctors visits we had with different doctors, they mostly advised me to not stop breastfeeding all together even though my son is developing severe eczema, and I had a strong feeling it was because of my breastmilk. It was all he was drinking at the time. After talking with Leo’s primary pediatrician about my concern, she suggested we could try feeding him hypoallergenic formulas such as Alimentum and Nutramigen. Leo was not taking it at all, he would not even take a sip. I knew he wouldn’t take it just by the smell. It smelled so horrible. I then went back to Similac Sensitive, but went to Similac Pro Sensitive instead. I noticed his skin was a bit better. But, he was still itching and his eczema was still there. One thing I did notice, and I wish I noticed it sooner. But, when Leo drinks the formulas he would have this phlegm like wheezing and breathing. I brought it up and it wasn’t a concern to the doctors. So, I continued feeding him milk-based formulas.

But, I completely stopped breastfeeding after I found out my son has severe/life threatening allergies to many things. I was eating everything he was allergic to! Leo's pediatrician notified my of his allergies and to advised to stop breastfeeding now, and referred us to an Allergist. The best thing I chose to do for my son was to see an allergist. Due to the severity of Leo’s eczema, the Allergist could not do a skin prick because he had no clear patch on his skin. Instead, we had blood work done. The doctor put in an order to test him for the TOP 8 and other common allergens, and many came back positive and some were extremely life threatening.

He was able to tolerate milk and soy okay or so I thought. I did not know how badly it affected him until I switched from Similac Pro Sensitive to Kabrita Goat Milk. I suggested goat milk to the Allergist, and he was okay with me trying it. I’ve tried almost every formula you can imagine to help my baby. But, none of the formulas made as big of a difference then switching to Kabrita Goat Milk. It is a life changing product. I’m not even exaggerating.

**TESTING OUT KABRITA GOAT MILK FORMULA**

I did so much research to find formula alternatives and even spent hundreds of dollars trying various formulas to see a difference. But, I kept seeing goat milk as one of the best alternative to breastmilk. I was so skeptical because ..goat milk? I’ve never tried it and I haven’t heard anyone say they feed their babies goat milk. I did my research on goat milk and I came across Kabrita. According to the Kabrita website, “Naturally easy to digest, goat milk is an ideal protein base for baby formula. Like cow milk, goat milk must also be adapted and fortified to meet the specific nutritional needs of little ones.” The ingredients list was impressive and very simplified with explanations on the site, and the plus is that it is NON-GMO. I was anxious to try this and discovered Walmart and Amazon sold this. I bought 2 cans to start and waited till he was close to a year old to try, because the can was labeled for 12 months-24 months available. (Please do your own research and consult with your doctor if you want to try. Things that work for my baby might be different for your baby. Every baby is different.)

My son used to constantly scratch all day and night and even in his sleep. But, after drinking Kabrita he only itches here and there, but not as bad as before, and his skin does still flare up from time. But, within 2-3 weeks, his face and body that was covered in infected eczema had cleared up significantly. The product is definitely not cheap, but I’m willing to try and spend anything to have my baby healed and happy. Thank you to Kabrita for making the most life changing product ever, without this goat milk formula my baby would never be able to heal.

Also, please note that the change in formula does have the biggest impact on the result of my son’s eczema, but we also had to come up with a daily skincare routine to really make sure that his skin results stay consistent. Please stay tuned for my next post where I will share with you my son’s skincare routine. Have you tried Kabrita Goat Milk? How was your experience?

These photos showed his progress from switching to Kabrita and changing his daily and skincare routine. I would say the first picture is from January and the last is from today (October 9,2020)![](/uploads/modern-blog-post-quote-in-notification-alert-social-media-post-2.png)
