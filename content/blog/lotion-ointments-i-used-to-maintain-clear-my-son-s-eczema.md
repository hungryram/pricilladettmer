Ever since I found out that my toddler developed eczema and has food allergies, our daily life has a been a roller coaster of emotions and (sometimes rewarding) challenges. Everything he touches, or eats could cause a flare up that could sometimes last for days. It had gotten so bad that his eczema would get so infected and he had lost all of his hair, and a few times he ended up in the ER. The doctor assured us that this was normal, and he will completely grow out of it. I couldn’t accept seeing my son suffer for years like that and was determined to change everything and anything to help my son’s skin get better and heal.

After many trials of using different lotions, creams, and ointment. This is the combination that has worked for my son, and we have been using these ointment/creams for a while now. I wanted to add that everything we have been using has been approved by his Pediatrician and Allergist. Please consult your doctor before trying anything new.

AQUAPHOR- My son’s skin condition was pretty unique to me, nothing I mean nothing was moisturizing his skin. He would be moisturized for a few minutes and then it would just disappear as if I never put anything on. Until, I tried using Aquaphor and combining it with other lotion. I use this every day and it has been a life changing ointment. I have tried Vaseline, but it did not work as well as Aquaphor. This ointment helps to lock in the moisture of his skin and lasts longer than other ointments I have tried. I apply this ointment throughout the day, from his head to toe. (Apply all day)

Vanicream- I used to work in the pharmacy, and I found Vanicream and loved it ever since. This lotion is thick and creamy and helps my son’s dry skin to stay moisturized. I always use Vanicream before Aquaphor all over his body. (Apply all day alternating between Sarna)

Eczema Honey- When my son’s skin first developed eczema, I would slather on Eczema Honey all over his face and body. I noticed it helped soothe his skin. Especially his face because it was cracking and inflamed. We went through so many jars of this and it was definitely pricey. But, it helped a lot when he developed a little redness or itch. You can pop it in the fridge for an extra cooling effect. (1-2x a day on face if a little itchy on face)

Sarna and/or Calamine lotion- I discovered Sarna cream a few months ago and loved that it controlled my son’s itch. We use Sarna whenever my son got super itchy on his legs, back of his neck, and body. We would apply Aquaphor after the Sarna to really lock it in. (Whenever he’s itchy, we try not to use it too much or we alternate with Calamine lotion.) The Calamine lotion can be a bit drying so we do spot treatments.

Prescription medication of Tacrolimus- We use this when my son’s flare up cannot be controlled by any of the above options. It instantly clears up his skin and the redness especially on his face within the hour. We try not to use it too much, but this cream definitely works really well.
