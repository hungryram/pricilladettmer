Let me just intro this by saying: I _love_ this recipe.

I love all our recipes, but this is one that just fits perfectly into my real life, again, and again, and again.

Veggie burgers can be hit or miss, I know. I’m not a fan of bean-heavy burgers, so please hear me right off the bat: I am not going to over-bean you with this quinoa burger.

Instead, I’m going to give you a stupidly easy burger that is heavy and solid but not too dense (seriously, pinky promise, the beans are under control!), crispy but not crumbly, and nicely meaty-looking… with all of the smoky good flavor, all of the yumminess, and none of the meat.

## HOW THESE QUINOA BURGERS COME TOGETHER

We are working with primarily three things:

* Quinoa – the star
* Black beans – just enough to help it hold
* Savory, smoky chipotle flavor – the thing that keeps you coming back for more.

Once you add something crunchy / binding (like panko or oats), and something wet / binding (egg or flax egg), and a few pinches of spices, you are certifiably in chipotle quinoa burger business.

These quinoa burgs can be made in minutes with just five-ish ingredients, and honestly, considering the minimal effort plus the excellent, versatile, and healthyish results, it’s a real weeknight unicorn.
