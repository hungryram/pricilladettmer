ingredients = "* 1/2 cup **uncooked quinoa**\n* 1 can **black beans**, rinsed and drained\n* 1–2 **chipotle peppers**\n* 1/2 teaspoon each: **garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, cumin**\n* 1 **egg**, beaten\n* 1 teaspoon **salt**\n* 1/4 cup **panko breadcrumbs**"
instructions = "1. **Quinoa:** Cook quinoa according to package directions. Allow to cool.\n2. **Mix:** Place black beans, quinoa, chipotles, and spices, in a food processor. Pulse just a few times, enough to make the mixture sticky and well-mixed but not completely pureed. Ideally there will be some chunks of black beans still intact.\n3. **Add egg and panko:** Transfer mixture to a bowl. Using a spoon or your hands, mix with egg and panko. Form into 4 thick burgers. \n4. **Fry burgers:** Heat a generous swish of olive oil over medium high heat (nonstick pan works best here). Add burgers to the pan and fry for a few minutes on each side, flipping carefully to keep them intact, until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside.\n5. **Serve:** Serve on buns with spicy mayo, avocado, lettuce, tomato, pickled red onion, whatever suits your fancy!

Let me just intro this by saying: I _love_ this recipe.

I love all our recipes, but this is one that just fits perfectly into my real life, again, and again, and again.

Veggie burgers can be hit or miss, I know. I’m not a fan of bean-heavy burgers, so please hear me right off the bat: I am not going to over-bean you with this quinoa burger.

Instead, I’m going to give you a stupidly easy burger that is heavy and solid but not too dense (seriously, pinky promise, the beans are under control!), crispy but not crumbly, and nicely meaty-looking… with all of the smoky good flavor, all of the yumminess, and none of the meat.

## HOW THESE QUINOA BURGERS COME TOGETHER

We are working with primarily three things:

* Quinoa – the star
* Black beans – just enough to help it hold
* Savory, smoky chipotle flavor – the thing that keeps you coming back for more.

Once you add something crunchy / binding (like panko or oats), and something wet / binding (egg or flax egg), and a few pinches of spices, you are certifiably in chipotle quinoa burger business.

These quinoa burgs can be made in minutes with just five-ish ingredients, and honestly, considering the minimal effort plus the excellent, versatile, and healthyish results, it’s a real weeknight unicorn.
